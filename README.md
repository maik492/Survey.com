# Survey Project

A simple mobile-friendly survey page with notes and MCQs.

## Features
- Write a personal note (saved in browser localStorage).
- Answer multiple choice questions.
- Shows a thank-you screen after submission.
- Clean, app-like design inspired by Instagram's vibe.

## How to host on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `survey-project`).
2. Upload these files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`).
3. Go to **Settings > Pages** in your repo.
4. Under "Build and deployment", select **Deploy from branch**.
5. Choose branch `main` (or `master`) and folder `/root`.
6. Save — after a few seconds, GitHub Pages will give you a live link.

## Usage
- Open the page on mobile or desktop browser.
- Write a note → submit → answer survey → see thank you message.
- Data is stored in browser localStorage (private to the device).
